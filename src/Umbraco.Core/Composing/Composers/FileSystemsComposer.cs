         * HOW TO REPLACE THE MEDIA UNDERLYING FILESYSTEM
         * ----------------------------------------------
         *
         * Create a component and use it to modify the composition by adding something like:
         *
         *   composition.Container.RegisterFileSystem<IMediaFileSystem, MediaFileSystem>(
         *       factory => new PhysicalFileSystem("~/somewhere"));
         *
         * return whatever supporting filesystem you like.
         *
         *
         * HOW TO IMPLEMENT MY OWN FILESYSTEM
         * ----------------------------------
         *
         * Create your filesystem class:
         *
         *   public class MyFileSystem : FileSystemWrapper
         *   {
         *       public MyFileSystem(IFileSystem innerFileSystem)
         *           : base(innerFileSystem)
         *       { }
         *   }
         *
         * The ctor can have more parameters that will be resolved by the container.
         *
         * Register your filesystem, in a component:
         *
         *    composition.Container.RegisterFileSystem<MyFileSystem>(
         *        factory => new PhysicalFileSystem("~/my"));
         *
         * And that's it, you can inject MyFileSystem wherever it's needed.
         *
         *
         * You can also declare a filesystem interface:
         *
         *   public interface IMyFileSystem : IFileSystem
         *   { }
         *
         * Make the class implement the interface, then
         * register your filesystem, in a component:
         *
         *    composition.Container.RegisterFileSystem<IMyFileSystem, MyFileSystem>(
         *        factory => new PhysicalFileSystem("~/my"));
         *
         * And that's it, you can inject IMyFileSystem wherever it's needed.
         *
         *
         * WHAT IS SHADOWING
         * -----------------
         *
         * Shadowing is the technology used for Deploy to implement some sort of
         * transaction-management on top of filesystems. The plumbing explained above,
         * compared to creating your own physical filesystem, ensures that your filesystem
         * would participate into such transactions.
         *
