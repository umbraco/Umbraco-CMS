/// Artifacts are uniquely identified by their <see cref="Udi" />, however they represent
/// elements in Umbraco that may be uniquely identified by another value. For example,
/// a content type is uniquely identified by its alias. If someone creates a new content
/// type, and tries to deploy it to a remote environment where a content type with the
/// same alias already exists, both content types end up having different <see cref="Udi" />
/// but the same alias. By default, Deploy would fail and throw when trying to save the
/// new content type (duplicate alias). However, if the connector also implements this
/// interface, the situation can be detected beforehand and reported in a nicer way.
