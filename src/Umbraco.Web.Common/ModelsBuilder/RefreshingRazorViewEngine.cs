/*
 * OVERVIEW:
 *
 * The CSharpCompiler is responsible for the actual compilation of razor at runtime.
 * It creates a CSharpCompilation instance to do the compilation. This is where DLL references
 * are applied. However, the way this works is not flexible for dynamic assemblies since the references
 * are only discovered and loaded once before the first compilation occurs. This is done here:
 * https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/114f0f6d1ef1d777fb93d90c87ac506027c55ea0/src/Mvc/Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation/src/CSharpCompiler.cs#L79
 * The CSharpCompiler is internal and cannot be replaced or extended, however it's references come from:
 * RazorReferenceManager. Unfortunately this is also internal and cannot be replaced, though it can be extended
 * using MvcRazorRuntimeCompilationOptions, except this is the place where references are only loaded once which
 * is done with a LazyInitializer. See https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/src/Mvc/Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation/src/RazorReferenceManager.cs#L35.
 *
 * The way that RazorReferenceManager works is by resolving references from the ApplicationPartsManager - either by
 * an application part that is specifically an ICompilationReferencesProvider or an AssemblyPart. So to fulfill this
 * requirement, we add the MB assembly to the assembly parts manager within the PureLiveModelFactory when the assembly
 * is (re)generated. But due to the above restrictions, when re-generating, this will have no effect since the references
 * have already been resolved with the LazyInitializer in the RazorReferenceManager.
 *
 * The services that can be replaced are: IViewCompilerProvider (default is the internal RuntimeViewCompilerProvider) and
 * IViewCompiler (default is the internal RuntimeViewCompiler). There is one specific public extension point that I was
 * hoping would solve all of the problems which was IMetadataReferenceFeature (implemented by LazyMetadataReferenceFeature
 * which uses RazorReferencesManager) which is a razor feature that you can add
 * to the RazorProjectEngine. It is used to resolve roslyn references and by default is backed by RazorReferencesManager.
 * Unfortunately, this service is not used by the CSharpCompiler, it seems to only be used by some tag helper compilations.
 *
 * There are caches at several levels, all of which are not publicly accessible APIs (apart from RazorViewEngine.ViewLookupCache
 * which is possible to clear by casting and then calling cache.Compact(100); but that doesn't get us far enough).
 *
 * For this to work, several caches must be cleared:
 * - RazorViewEngine.ViewLookupCache
 * - RazorReferencesManager._compilationReferences
 * - RazorPageActivator._activationInfo (though this one may be optional)
 * - RuntimeViewCompiler._cache
 *
 * What are our options?
 *
 * a) We can copy a ton of code into our application: CSharpCompiler, RuntimeViewCompilerProvider, RuntimeViewCompiler and
 *    RazorReferenceManager (probably more depending on the extent of Internal references).
 * b) We can use reflection to try to access all of the above resources and try to forcefully clear caches and reset initialization flags.
 * c) We hack these replace-able services with our own implementations that wrap the default services. To do this
 *    requires re-resolving the original services from a pre-built DI container. In effect this re-creates these
 *    services from scratch which means there is no caches.
 *
 * ... Option C works, we will use that but need to verify how this affects memory since ideally the old services will be GC'd.
 *
 * Option C, how its done:
 * - Before we add our custom razor services to the container, we make a copy of the services collection which is the snapshot of registered services
 *   with razor defaults before ours are added.
 * - We replace the default implementation of IRazorViewEngine with our own. This is a wrapping service that wraps the default RazorViewEngine instance.
 *   The ctor for this service takes in a Factory method to re-construct the default RazorViewEngine and all of it's dependency graph.
 * - When the PureLive models change, the Factory is invoked and the default razor services are all re-created, thus clearing their caches and the newly
 *   created instance is wrapped. The RazorViewEngine is the only service that needs to be replaced and wrapped for this to work because it's dependency
 *   graph includes all of the above mentioned services, all the way up to the RazorProjectEngine and it's LazyMetadataReferenceFeature.
