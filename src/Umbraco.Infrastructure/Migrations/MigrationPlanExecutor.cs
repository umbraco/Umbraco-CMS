/*
 * This is what runs our migration plans.
 * It's important to note that this was altered to allow for partial migration completions.
 * The need for this became apparent when we added support for SQLite.
 * The main issue being how SQLites handles altering the schema.
 * Long story short, SQLite doesn't support altering columns,
 * or adding non-nullable columns with non-trivial types, for instance GUIDs.
 *
 * The recommended workaround for this is to add a new table, migrate the data, and delete the old one,
 * however this causes issues with foreign keys. The recommended approach for this is to disable foreign keys entirely
 * when doing the migration. However, foreign keys MUST be disabled outside a transaction.
 * This was impossible with our previous migration system since it ALWAYS ran all migrations in a single transaction
 * meaning that the transaction will always have been started when your migration is run, so you can't disable FKs.
 *
 * To now support this the UnscopedMigrationBase was added, which allows you to create a migration with no transaction.
 * But this requires each migration to run in its own scope,
 * meaning we can't roll back the entire plan, but only a single migration.
 *
 * Hence the need for partial migration completions.
