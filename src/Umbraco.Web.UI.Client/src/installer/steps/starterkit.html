  <p>The Starter Kit is a great way to experience some of the ways you can use Umbraco. It's a complete website with textpages, landing pages, blog, product listings and more that's easy to get started with Umbraco. 
  </p>
  <p>
    It's also a great way to learn Umbraco as the Starter Kit comes with a set of Lessons that'll teach you how to implement and extend Umbraco using short 5-15 minute tasks.
