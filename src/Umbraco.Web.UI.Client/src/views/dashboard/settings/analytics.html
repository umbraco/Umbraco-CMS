        <p>In order to improve Umbraco and add new functionality based on as relevant information as possible,
          <br>we would like to collect system- and usage information from your installation.
          <br>We will NOT collect any personal data like content, code or users, and all data will be fully anonymous.
          <br>
          <br>We will on a regular basis share some of the overall learnings from these metrics.
          Hopefully, you'll help us collect some valuable data.</p>

          <br>- Statistics, like number of content nodes and number of media items

          <br>
          <br>We might change/extend what we send on the detailed level in the future, but if so, it will be listed in
          this view.
