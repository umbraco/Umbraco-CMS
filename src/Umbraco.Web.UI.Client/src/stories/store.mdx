# Store

A store is the link between a Resource and a data implementation. A store is mainly taken form as a Context, In other words we will have to Consume the Context(Store) to get the Store.
Generally a Store will be holding one or more RxJS Subjects, each Subject is made available for Subscription via a RxJS Observable.

### A Simple Store:

```typescript
class MyProductStore {
	#products = new ArrayState(<Array<MyProductType>>[], (product) => product.key);

	public readonly products = this.#products.asObservable();

	protected host: UmbControllerHostElement;
	constructor(host: UmbControllerHostElement) {
		this.host = host;

		// The Store provides it self as a Context-API.
		new UmbContextProviderController(_host, 'MyStoreContextAlias', this);
	}
}
```

In this example we created a ArrayState, A State which is specific to Arrays.
This holds the data for one or more Observables to convey for outsiders.

This example shows how to use the store:

```typescript
class MyImplementation extends UmbLitElement {
	private _myProductStore?: MyProductStore;

	constructor() {
		super();

		// Notice the consume callback is triggered initially and everytime the Context is changed.
		this.consume('MyStoreContextAlias', (context) => {
			this._myProductStore = context;

			this._observeAllProducts();
		});
	}

	private _observeAllProducts() {
		if (!this._myProductStore) return;

		// Notice this callback will be triggered initially and each time the products change:
		this.observe(this._myProductStore.products, (products) => {
			console.log('The data of all products is:', products);
		});
	}
}
```

### A bit more meaningful Store:

Here we added a method that returns an Observable that is specific to the requested product.

```typescript
class MyProductStore {

	...

	getByKey(key: string) {

		// Request data via a Resource to then take part of this state when recieved.
		tryExecuteAndNotify(this.host, ProductResource.getByKey({key})).then(({ data }) => {
			if (data) {
				this.#products.append(data.items);
			}
		});

		// Return a Observable part, to listen for this specific product and the future changes of it.
		return this.#data.getObservablePart((documents) =>
			documents.find((document) => document.key === key)
		);
	}
}
```

An example using this method:

```typescript
class MyImplementation extends UmbLitElement {
	private _myProductStore?: MyProductStore;

	constructor() {
		super();

		// Notice the consume callback is triggered initially and everytime the Context is changed.
		this.consume('MyStoreContextAlias', (context) => {
			this._myProductStore = context;

			this._observeASpecificProduct();
		});
	}

	private _observeASpecificProduct() {
		if (!this._myProductStore) return;

		// Notice this callback will be triggered initially and each time the specific product change:
		this.observe(this._myProductStore.getByKey('1234'), (product) => {
			console.log('The data of product `1234`` is:', product);
		});
	}
}
```

### Create many Observables:

A Store must hold different Observables some very general and others specific. All in perspective of what types of observes we like to accommodate.

This example give some inspiration to how fine grained this can become:

```typescript
class MyProductStore {
  #products = new ArrayState(<Array<MyProductType>>[]);

  public readonly products = this.#products.asObservable();
  public readonly amountOfProducts = this.#products.getObservablePart((products) => products.length);
  public readonly topTenRatedProducts = this.#products.getObservablePart((products) => products.sort((a, b) => b.rating - a.rating).slice(0, 10));

  ...
}
```

An observer of an Observable will only be triggered if the specific part of that data has changed.
With this we can make a high performant application, only triggering the parts that needs to update when data is changed.

### Ensure unique data:

For incoming data to replace existing data, we need to clarify what makes a entry of the array unique.
In the examples of this guide each product has a key, and we have clarified this to the State by giving it the little method `(product) => product.key` as part of the its creation:

```typescript
class MyProductStore {
  #products = new ArrayState(<Array<MyProductType>>[], (product) => product.key);
  ...
}
```
