In this document you will get a overview of the articles — Enabling you to get started with the parts that makes sense for you.

# Temology
There is a few words that covers certain concepts, which is good to learn to easilier decode the purpose of code.

- **Resource** A API enabling communication with a server. [Go to Context API Guide](/?path=/story/guides-resource--page)
- **Store** A API representing data, generally coming from the server. Most stores would talk with one or more resources. [Go to Context API Guide](/?path=/story/guides-store--page)

- **State** A reactive data store, holding some data, when data is changed all observers will be notified, if relevant.
- **Observable** An observable is the hook for others to subscribe to the data or part of the data of a State.
- **Observe** Observe is the term of what we do when subscriping to a Observable.

- **Context-API** The name of the system used to serve APIs(instances/classes) that for a certain context in the DOM. An API that is served via the Context-API is called a Context [Go to Context API Guide](/?path=/story/guides-umbraco-element--page)
- **Context Provider** One that provides a class instance as a Context API.
- **Context Consumer** One that consumer/subscripes to a class instance as a Context API.

- **Controller** An abstract term for a things that hooks into the lifecycle of a element. Many things in our system is Controllers, As a example notice these controllers:
- **Context Provider Controller** A Context Provider as a Controller, this make its easy to implement a Context Provider.
- **Context Consumer Controller** A Context Consumer as a Controller, this make its easy to implement a Context Consumer.
- **Observer Controller** A Controller for handling the observe subscription for a Observable.

- **Controller Host** The element that can host one or more controllers.
- **Umbraco Element** The UmbLitElement or UmbElemenMixin is a implementation of the Controller Host as an element. Using this as your base element provides a few methods that makes life easier. [Go to Umbraco Element Guide](/?path=/story/guides-umbraco-element--page)
