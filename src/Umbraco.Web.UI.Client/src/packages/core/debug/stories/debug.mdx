# Debugging

## Debugging Contexts

The component `<umb-debug>` allows you to discover the available contexts from the current DOM element, that you are able to consume and use.

For example it will help you as a package developer or implementor to know you are able to consume the `DigalogService` and quickly see what properties and methods are available to use.

This can help with the developer experience to quickly see what is available to use and how to use it.

### Usage

The `<umb-debug>` component can be used in two different ways, either as a button or as a dialog. By default it is rendered as a button and the debug information about available contexts is displayed inline to where the `umb-debug` element is placed.

<img src={DebugImage} width="100%" />

```typescript
// This will add a Debug button to the UI and once clicked the information about avilable contextes will slide down
<umb-debug visible></umb-debug>
```

#### Dialog

This example uses an additional property/attribute `dialog` which adds a smaller badge to the UI as opposed to a button and will open the information in a dialog/modal on the right hand side, this may be more useful to use when space is limited in the UI to add a button and pane of information directly to where the element is placed.

<img src={DebugDialogImage} width="100%" />

```typescript
// This will open the debug information in a small dialog/modal from the right hand side
<umb-debug visible dialog></umb-debug>
```

#### Disable

You may wish to temporarily hide or disable the debug information but return to it later on in the development process.

```typescript
// To hide or remove the button ensure you remove the `visible` attribute or set it to false
<umb-debug></umb-debug>

<umb-debug ?visible=${false}></umb-debug>
```
