#Belle Lab in Aarhus, May 28th

*Today was the first day with an open belle lab event, kindly hosted by the great people at Illumi in Aarhus. It was the first time the Belle prototype really got into the hands of developers, with the primary goal of getting people up and running and contributing*

The day kicked off with a fast and condensed introduction to belle and AngularJS, the JS framework we've decided to build belle on, afterwards, the event split into 2 tracks. 

- 1 group focused on working on the conceptual level in regards to user experience
- the other focused on diving into the codebase and getting familiar with the new approach to extending the backoffice.
