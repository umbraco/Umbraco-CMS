<div class="description"><div class="umbraco-directives-directive-page umbraco-directives-directive-valformmanager-page"><p>Used to broadcast an event to all elements inside this one to notify that form validation has
changed. If we don&#39;t use this that means you have to put a watch for each directive on a form&#39;s validation
changing which would result in much higher processing. We need to actually watch the whole $error collection of a form
because just watching $valid or $invalid doesn&#39;t acurrately trigger form validation changing.
This also sets the show-validation (or a custom) css class on the element when the form is invalid - this lets
us css target elements to be displayed when the form is submitting/submitted.
Another thing this directive does is to ensure that any .control-group that contains form elements that are invalid will
be marked with the &#39;error&#39; css class. This ensures that labels included in that control group are styled correctly.</p>
