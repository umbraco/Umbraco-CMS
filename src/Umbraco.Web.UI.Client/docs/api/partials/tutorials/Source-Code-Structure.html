<p>This document outlines where the different files in the Umbraco 7 source code is. 
The Client-side part of Umbraco 7 is located in the project folder: `Umbraco.Web.Ui.Client</p>
<h3 id="root-folders">Root folders</h3>
<p>The folders found in the root of the client-side project and what they contain:</p>
<p><em>/Assets</em>
This folder contains various client-side assets, most of them are obsolete by now and will over time be merged into the source</p>
<p><em>/Build</em>
The folder containing the compiled and minified bits outputted by grunt</p>
<p><em>/Docs</em>
Automated documentation files by ngdoc project from inline comments in source files as well as from .ngdoc files in /docs/src/</p>
<p><em>/Lib</em>
Folder containing all 3rd party dependencies used by the Umbraco web application</p>
<p><em>/node_modules</em>
Dependencies used by node and grunt to build the project</p>
<p><em>/src</em>
The source code of Umbraco 7 UI</p>
<p><em>/test</em>
Test configuration and test files used by the karma testrunner to unit-test the project.</p>
<h3 id="source-folders">Source folders</h3>
<p>Inside the /src folder, the Umbraco 7 source code is devided into 3 groups of code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Less files</li>
<li>Common / shared javascript </li>
<li>Views </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="source-folders_less-files">Less files</h4>
<p>Everything is loaded into the belle.less which specifies what files to include, the variables.less contains global variabls</p>
<h4 id="source-folders_/views">/Views</h4>
<p>The Views folder contains all the html for the application as well as the Controllers used on those views. The convention for views and controllers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>/views/section/Viewname.html</li>
<li>/views/section/section.viewname.controller.js</li>
</ul>
<p>So if you are looking for the html and javascript used by the content editor look in /src/views/content/edit.html and <code>/src/vies/content/content.edit.controller.js</code></p>
<h4 id="source-folders_/common">/Common</h4>
<p>The Common folder contains all the items that are share between multiple parts of the application, such as Services, Directives and Filters.</p>
<p>So if you want to access the navigationService look in <code>/src/common/services/navigation.service.js</code></p>
<p>For the Umbraco 7 application, we also have introduce the concept of a <code>Resource</code>, this term is used for a shared service which primarily is used to access data from the database and perform crud operations on this data. </p>
<p>Example resources could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>/src/common/resources/media.resource.js</li>
<li>/src/common/resources/entity.resource.js</li>
</ul>
<p>All resources returns a promise when data is fetched, they use the same pattern for errors and generally require a http backend to work.
On our serverless setup, we use a mocked http backend to simulate data.</p>
<h4 id="source-folders_packages">Packages</h4>
<p>Folder containing various sample projects on how to use the external api, good for referencing how the package.manifest and property editors work. </p>
<h4 id="source-folders_appjs-and-appdevjs">App.js and app.dev.js</h4>
<p>The central application script, which handles what modules to inject, app.js is for production, app.dev.js is for testing</p>
<h4 id="source-folders_loaderjs">loader.js</h4>
<p>lazyload.js based loader for async loading javascript files, this file specifies what files to load on application start</p>
<h4 id="source-folders_routesjs">routes.js</h4>
<p>Routing setup for /umbraco/ pages, by default it contains a mvc-like convention based pattern, which means that we not very often need to modify this.</p>
