## UI Extension Conditions

Extension conditions are used to determine if an extension should be used or not.
Many of the Extension Types supports conditions, but not all of them.

All given conditions for an extension must be valid for an extension to be utilized.

### Using conditions

In this following example we define the manifest for a Workspace Action, this action will only be available in the workspace with the alias `My.Example.Workspace`.

```typescript
{
	type: 'workspaceAction',
	name: 'example-workspace-action',
	alias: 'My.Example.WorkspaceAction',
	elementName: 'my-workspace-action-element',
	conditions: [
		{
			alias: 'Umb.Condition.SectionAlias',
			matches: 'My.Example.Workspace'
		}
	]
}
```

The conditions are defined as an array of conditions.
Each condition is an object with the following properties:

- `alias`- The alias of the condition to utilize.
- `...` - The rest of the properties of the object are specific to the condition.

In the above example the `Umb.Condition.SectionAlias` condition is used, this condition takes a property `matches` which must be set to the alias of the section to match.

### Core conditions types

The following conditions are available out of the box, for all extension types that support conditions.

- `Umb.Condition.SectionAlias` - Checks if the current section alias matches the one specified.
- `Umb.Condition.WorkspaceAlias` - Checks if the current workspace alias matches the one specified.

### Make your own conditions

You can make your own conditions by creating a class that implements the `UmbExtensionCondition` interface.

```typescript
import { UmbBaseController } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/controller-api';
import {
	ManifestCondition,
	UmbConditionConfigBase,
	UmbConditionControllerArguments,
	UmbExtensionCondition,
} from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/extension-api';
import { UMB_SECTION_CONTEXT_TOKEN } from '@umbraco-cms/backoffice/section';

type MyConditionConfig = UmbConditionConfigBase & {
	match: string;
};

export class MyExtensionCondition extends UmbBaseController implements UmbExtensionCondition {
	config: MyConditionConfig;
	permitted = false;

	constructor(args: UmbConditionControllerArguments<MyConditionConfig>) {
		super(args.host);
		// This condition aproves after 10 seconds
		setTimeout(() => {
			this.permitted = strue;
			args.onChange();
		}, 10000);
	}
}
```

This has to be registered in the extension registry, like this:

TODO: Make an example that will work from JSON (not a direct reference to the class).

```typescript
export const manifest: ManifestCondition = {
	type: 'condition',
	name: 'My Condition',
	alias: 'My.Condition.TenSecondDelay',
	class: MyExtensionCondition,
};
```
