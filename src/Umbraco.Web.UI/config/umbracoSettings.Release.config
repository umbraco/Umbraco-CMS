    <!-- How Umbraco should handle errors during macro execution. Can be one of the following values:
         - inline - show an inline error within the macro but allow the page to continue rendering. Historial Umbraco behaviour.
         - silent - Silently suppress the error and do not render the offending macro.
         - throw  - Throw an exception which can be caught by the global error handler defined in Application_OnError. If no such
                    error handler is defined then you'll see the Yellow Screen Of Death (YSOD) error page.
         Note the error can also be handled by the umbraco.macro.Error event, where you can log/alarm with your own code and change the behaviour per event. -->

    When distributed call is enabled, you need to add all of the servers part taking in load balancing
    to the server list below. 
    -->

    <servers>

      <!-- 
      Add ip number or hostname, make sure that it can be reached from all servers
      you can also add optional attributes to force a protocol or port number.
      
      Examples:
      
      <server>127.0.0.1</server>
      <server forceProtocol="http|https" forcePortnumber="80|443">127.0.0.1</server>
      
      Generally when setting up load balancing you will designate a 'master' server, 
      Umbraco will always assume that the FIRST server listed in this list is the 'master'.
      (NOTE: Not all load balancing scenarios have a 'master', depends on how you are setting it up)
      
      In order for scheduled tasks (including scheduled publishing) to work properly when load balancing, each 
      server in the load balanced environment needs to know if it is the 'master'. In order for servers
      to know this or not, they need to compare some values against the servers listed. These values
      are either: serverName or appId. You should not enter both values but appId will always supersede serverName.
      The serverName is the easiest and will work so long as you are not load balancing your site on the same server.
      If you are doing this, then you will need to use appId which is equivalent to the value returned from
      HttpRuntime.AppDomainAppId. It is recommended that you set either the serverName or appId for all servers 
      registered here if possible, not just the first one.
      
      Examples:
      
      <server serverName="MyServer">server1.mysite.com</server>      
      <server appId="/LM/W3SVC/69/ROOT">server1.mysite.com</server>      
      -->

    web.routing
      @trySkipIisCustomErrors
        Tries to skip IIS custom errors.
        Starting with IIS 7.5, this must be set to true for Umbraco 404 pages to show. Else, IIS will take
        over and render its build-in error page. See MS doc for HttpResponseBase.TrySkipIisCustomErrors.
        The default value is false, for backward compatibility reasons, which means that IIS _will_ take
        over, and _prevent_ Umbraco 404 pages to show.
      @internalRedirectPreservesTemplate
        By default as soon as we're not displaying the initial document, we reset the template set by the
        finder or by the alt. template. Set this option to true to preserve the template set by the finder
        or by the alt. template, in case of an internal redirect.
        (false by default, and in fact should remain false unless you know what you're doing)
      @disableAlternativeTemplates
        By default you can add a altTemplate querystring or append a template name to the current URL which
        will make Umbraco render the content on the current page with the template you requested, for example:
        http://mysite.com/about-us/?altTemplate=Home and http://mysite.com/about-us/Home would render the 
        "About Us" page with a template with the alias Home. Setting this setting to true stops that behavior
