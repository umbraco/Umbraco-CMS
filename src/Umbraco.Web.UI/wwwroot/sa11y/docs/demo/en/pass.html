          <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike
            carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide
            variety of habitats throughout the
            Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North
            America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with
            stocky legs, long
            snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
          </p>

          <p>While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
            remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting individuals and
            mothers with their young, bears
            are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animals" target="_blank">solitary animals.
              <span class="sr-only">(opens in new window)</span><span class="fa fa-external-link-alt"></span></a> They
            may be diurnal or
            nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept
            runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species
            occupy their dens during
            the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.</p>

      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>The family Ursidae is one of the nine families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans, within
        the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears
        comprise eight species
        in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the
        spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the
        authority). Nuclear chromosome
        analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes,
        whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers can be explained
        by the fusing of
        some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those
        of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in Procyonidae, where
        they had been placed
        by some earlier authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis
            (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30
            Mya), both from North
            America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall
            appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and
            Africa until the
            Miocene.[14] It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal
            exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early
            as the late Eocene (about 37
            Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon,
            and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including
            Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.

      <h2>Size</h2>
      <p>The raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily Hemicyoninae, which first
        appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya.[15] The subfamily includes the younger genera
        Phoberocyon (20–15
        Mya), and Plithocyon (15–7 Mya). A Cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus Ursavus during the early
        Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living bears.
        Species of Ursavus
        subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during the early Miocene
        (21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15 and 20 Mya,[24][25]
        likely via the species
        Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to
        diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about 5
        Mya.</p>
