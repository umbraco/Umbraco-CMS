          <p>Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniforms" target="_blank">caniforms (opens in new window)</a>, or
            doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a
            wide variety of habitats throughout the
            Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North
            America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with
            stocky legs, long
            snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.
          </p>

          <p>While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
            remaining six species are <strong>omnivorous with varied diets.</strong> With the exception of courting
            individuals and
            mothers with their young, bears
            are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animals" target="_blank">solitary
              animals.</a> They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy
            build and awkward gait, they are
            adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most
            species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.</p>

            <p>The FAMILY URSIDAE IS ONE OF THE NINE families in the suborder Caniformia, or "doglike" carnivorans,
              within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids.
              Modern bears comprise eight species
              in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the
              spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the
              authority). Nuclear chromosome
              analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74
              chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers
              can be explained by the fusing of
              some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from
              those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in Ursidae rather than in
              Procyonidae, where they had been placed
              by some earlier authorities.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="ignore-me">The earliest members of Ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae,
          including Parictis (late
          Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya),
          both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like
          in overall appearance, with diets perhaps more similar to that of a badger. Parictis does not appear in
          Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene.[14] It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in
          Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea
          level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European
          genera morphologically very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya),
          are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.</p>

        <h2>Size</h2>
        <p><em>The raccoon-sized, dog-like Cephalogale is the oldest-known member of the subfamily Hemicyoninae, which
            first appeared during the middle Oligocene in Eurasia about 30 Mya.[15] The subfamily includes the younger
            genera Phoberocyon (20–15
            Mya), and Plithocyon (15–7 Mya). A Cephalogale-like species gave rise to the genus Ursavus during the early
            Oligocene (30–28 Mya); this genus proliferated into many species in Asia and is ancestral to all living
            bears. Species of Ursavus
            subsequently entered North America, together with Amphicynodon and Cephalogale, during the early Miocene
            (21–18 Mya). Members of the living lineages of bears diverged from Ursavus between 15 and 20 Mya,[24][25]
            likely via the species
            Ursavus elmensis. Based on genetic and morphological data, the Ailuropodinae (pandas) were the first to
            diverge from other living bears about 19 Mya, although no fossils of this group have been found before about
            5 Mya.</em></p>
