# Review process

You're an awesome person and have sent us your contribution in the form of a pull request! It's now time to relax for a bit and wait for our response. 

In order to set some expectations, here's what happens next.

## Review process

You will get an initial reply within 48 hours (workdays) to acknowledge that we’ve seen your PR and we’ll pick it up as soon as we can.

You will get feedback within at most 14 days after opening the PR. You’ll most likely get feedback sooner though. Then there are a few possible outcomes:

- Your proposed change is awesome! We merge it in and it will be included in the next minor release of Umbraco
- If the change is a high priority bug fix, we will cherry-pick it into the next patch release as well so that we can release it as soon as possible
- Your proposed change is awesome but needs a bit more work, we’ll give you feedback on the changes we’d like to see
- Your proposed change is awesome but.. not something we’re looking to include at this point. We’ll close your PR and the related issue (we’ll be nice about it!)

## Are you still available?

We understand you have other things to do and can't just drop everything to help us out.   
So if we’re asking for your help to improve the PR we’ll wait for two weeks to give you a fair chance to make changes. We’ll ask for an update if we don’t hear back from you after that time.  

If we don’t hear back from you for 4 weeks, we’ll close the PR so that it doesn’t just hang around forever. You’re very welcome to re-open it once you have some more time to spend on it.  

There will be times that we really like your proposed changes and we’ll finish the final improvements we’d like to see ourselves. You still get the credits and your commits will live on in the git repository.
