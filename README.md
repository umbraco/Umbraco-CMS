## Umbraco CMS ##
Umbraco is a free open source Content Management System built on the ASP.NET platform. Our mission is to help you deliver delightful digital experiences by making Umbraco friendly, simpler and social.


## Building Umbraco from source ##

The easiest way to get started is to run `build/build.bat` which will build both the backoffice (also known as "Belle") and the Umbraco core. You can then easily start debugging from Visual Studio, or if you need to debug Belle you can run `grunt vs` in `src\Umbraco.Web.UI.Client`.
 
If you're interested in making changes to Belle without running Visual Studio make sure to read the [Belle ReadMe file](src/Umbraco.Web.UI.Client/README.md). 

Note that you can always [download a nightly build](http://nightly.umbraco.org/?container=umbraco-750) so you don't have to build the code yourself.

## Umbraco - The Friendly CMS ##

For the first time on the Microsoft platform, there is a free user and developer friendly CMS that makes it quick and easy to create websites - or a breeze to build complex web applications. Umbraco has award-winning integration capabilities and supports ASP.NET MVC or Web Forms, including User and Custom Controls, out of the box. 

Umbraco is not only loved by developers, but is a content editors dream. Enjoy intuitive editing tools, media management, responsive views and approval workflows to send your content live.

Backed by the team at Umbraco HQ, and supported by a dedicated community of over 200,000 craftspeople globally, you can trust that Umbraco is a safe choice and is here to stay.
