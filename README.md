Umbraco CMS
===========
Umbraco is a free open source Content Management System built on the ASP.NET platform.

## Building Umbraco from source ##
The easiest way to get started is to run `build/build.bat` which will build both the backoffice (also known as "Belle") and the Umbraco core. You can then easily start debugging from Visual Studio, or if you need to debug Belle you can run `grunt dev` in `src\Umbraco.Web.UI.Client`.
 
If you're interested in making changes to Belle make sure to read the [Belle ReadMe file](src/Umbraco.Web.UI.Client/README.md). Note that you can always [download a nightly build](http://nightly.umbraco.org/umbraco%207.0.0/) so you don't have to build the code yourself.
