# Contribute to the Documentation

Documentation is a major part of the Umbraco project as it allows users and developers to come to grips with ins and outs of the system.  There is nothing more frustrating than trying to understand an API or feature when there is no official documentation explaining how it works! This was one of the reasons why the documentation project was created.  By helping contribute to the documentation project you are not only helping those that currently use Umbraco, but also the multitude of developers who are new to the platform.

The scope of this project is to provide overviews of concepts, tutorials, example code, and links to API references. It is always a work in progress, and we welcome valuable contributions from anyone willing to help. For details on how to contribute, see further down this page.

The documentation project lives at GitHub which provides an effective way of managing project documentation.
