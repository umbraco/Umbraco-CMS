# Contributing to Umbraco CMS

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Umbraco CMS.

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Remember, we're a friendly bunch and are happy with whatever contribution you might provide. Below are guidelines for success that we've gathered over the years. If you choose to ignore them then we still love you üíñ.

## Contributing code changes

This document gives you a quick overview on how to get started, we will link to in-depth documentation throughout if you need some more background info.


## Guidelines for contributions we welcome

Not all changes are wanted, so on occassion we might close a PR without merging it. We will give you feedback why we can't accept your changes and we'll be nice about it, thanking you for spending your valuable time.

We have [documented what we consider small and large changes](CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md). Make sure to talk to us before making large changes.

Remember, if an issue is in the `Up for grabs` list or you've asked for some feedback before you sent us a PR, your PR will not be closed as unwanted.

## How do I begin?

Great question! The short version goes like this:

  * **Fork** - create a fork of [`Umbraco-CMS` on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)

  ![Fork the repository](img/forkrepository.png)

  * **Clone** - when GitHub has created your fork, you can clone it in your favorite Git tool

  * **Build** - build your fork of Umbraco locally as described in [building Umbraco from source code](BUILD.md)
  * **Change** - make your changes, experiment, have fun, explore and learn, and don't be afraid. We welcome all contributions and will [happily give feedback](#questions)
  * **Commit** - done? Yay! üéâ It is recommended to create a new branch now and name it after the issue you're fixing, we usually follow the format: `temp-12345`. This means it's a temporary branch for the particular issue you're working on, in this case `12345`
  * **Push** - great, now you can push the changes up to your fork on GitHub
  * **Create pull request** - exciting! You're ready to show us your changes (or not quite ready, you just need some feedback to progress). GitHub has picked up on the new branch you've pushed and will offer to create a Pull Request. Click that green button and away you go.

### Further reading

At this point you might want to [read on about contributing in depth](CONTRIBUTING_DETAILED.md). 

### Reviews

You've sent us your first contribution, congratulations! Now what?

The [pull request team](#the-pr-team) can now start reviewing your proposed changes and give you feedback on them. If it's not perfect, we'll either fix up what we need or we can request you to make some additional changes.

We have [a process in place which you can read all about](REVIEW_PROCESS.md). The very abbreviated version is:

- Your PR will get a reply within 48 hours
- An in-depth reply will be added within at most 2 weeks
- The PR will be either merged or rejected within at most 4 weeks
- Sometimes it is difficult to meet these timelines and we'll talk to you

## Styleguides

To be honest, we don't like rules very much. We trust you have the best of intentions and we encourage you to create working code. If it doesn't look perfect then we'll happily help clean it up.

That said, the Umbraco development team likes to follow the hints that ReSharper gives us (no problem if you don't have this installed) and we've added a `.editorconfig` file so that Visual Studio knows what to do with whitespace, line endings, etc.

## The PR team

The pull request team consists of a member of Umbraco HQ, [Sebastiaan](https://github.com/nul800sebastiaan), who gets assistance from the following community members

- [Anders Bjerner](https://github.com/abjerner)
- [Dave Woestenborghs](https://github.com/dawoe)
- [Emma Burstow](https://github.com/emmaburstow)
- [Poornima Nayar](https://github.com/poornimanayar)

These wonderful volunteers will provide you with a first reply to your PR, review and test out your changes and might ask more questions. After that they'll let Umbraco HQ know if everything seems okay. 

## Questions?

You can get in touch with [the PR team](#the-pr-team) in multiple ways, we love open conversations and we are a friendly bunch. No question you have is stupid. Any questions you have usually helps out multiple people with the same question. Ask away:

- If there's an existing issue on the issue tracker then that's a good place to leave questions and discuss how to start or move forward
- Unsure where to start? Did something not work as expected? Try leaving a note in the ["Contributing to Umbraco"](https://our.umbraco.com/forum/contributing-to-umbraco-cms/) forum, the team monitors that one closely
