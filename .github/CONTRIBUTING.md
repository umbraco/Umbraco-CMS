# Contributing to Umbraco CMS

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

These contribution guidelines are mostly just that - guidelines, not rules. This is what we've found to work best over the years, but if you choose to ignore them, we still love you! üíñ Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Getting Started
We have a guide on [what to consider before you start](contributing-before-you-start.md) and more detailed guides at the end of this article.

The following steps are a quick-start guide:

1. **Fork**

    Create a fork of [`Umbraco-CMS` on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)
    
    ![Fork the repository](img/forkrepository.png)
    
2. **Clone**

    When GitHub has created your fork, you can clone it in your favorite Git tool or on the command line with `git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Umbraco-CMS`.

3. **Switch to the correct branch**

    Switch to the `contrib` branch

4. **Build**

    Build your fork of Umbraco locally [as described in the build documentation](BUILD.md), you can build with any IDE that supports dotnet or the command line.

5. **Branch**

    Create a new branch now and name it after the issue you're fixing, we usually follow the format: `temp/12345`. This means it's a temporary branch for the particular issue you're working on, in this case issue number `12345`.  Don't commit to `contrib`, create a new branch first.

6. **Change**

    Make your changes, experiment, have fun, explore and learn, and don't be afraid. We welcome all contributions and will [happily give feedback](contributing-first-issue.md#questions).

7. **Commit and push**

    Done? Yay! üéâ

    Remember to commit to your new `temp` branch, and don't commit to `contrib`. Then you can push the changes up to your fork on GitHub.

8. **Create pull request**

    On GitHub, in your forked repository (`https://github.com/[YourUsername]/Umbraco-CMS`) you will see a banner saying that you pushed a new branch and a button to make a pull request. Tap the button and follow the instuctions.
