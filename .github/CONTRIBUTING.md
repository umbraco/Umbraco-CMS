# Contributing to Umbraco CMS

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

These contribution guidelines are mostly just that - guidelines, not rules. This is what we've found to work best over the years, but if you choose to ignore them, we still love you! 💖 Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get started on your first PR


1. **Fork**

    Create a fork of [`Umbraco-CMS` on GitHub][Umbraco CMS repo]
    
    ![Fork the repository](img/forkrepository.png)
    
1. **Clone**

    When GitHub has created your fork, you can clone it in your favorite Git tool
    
    ![Clone the fork](img/clonefork.png) 
    
1. **Switch to the correct branch**

    Switch to the `contrib` branch

1. **Build**

    Build your fork of Umbraco locally as described in the build documentation: you can [debug with Visual Studio Code][build - debugging with code] or [with Visual Studio][build - debugging with vs].

1. **Branch**

    Create a new branch now and name it after the issue you're fixing, we usually follow the format: `temp-12345`. This means it's a temporary branch for the particular issue you're working on, in this case issue number `12345`.  Don't commit to `contrib`, create a new branch first.

1. **Change**

    Make your changes, experiment, have fun, explore and learn, and don't be afraid. We welcome all contributions and will [happily give feedback][questions].

1. **Commit and push**

    Done? Yay! 🎉

    Remember to commit to your new `temp` branch, and don't commit to `contrib`. Then you can push the changes up to your fork on GitHub.
