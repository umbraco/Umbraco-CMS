## Coding Conventions

When developing new `Class Libraries` we will be adhereing as closely as possible to the official guidelines as proposed by Microsoft -http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229042.aspx

Another good reference is "Framework Design Guidelines: Conventions, Idioms, and Patterns for Reusable .NET Libraries" book by Krzysztof Cwalina and Brad Abrams.

Resharper settings are included with the solution, so developers can cleanup code in a consistent manner.

A special note about whitespace is in order. Usage should follow Visual Studio defaults which is 4 spaces for pretty much everything except for XML, which uses 2 spaces instead (again, this is the Visual Studio defaults).
