# Merging Your Code Into Umbraco

## Pull Requests

The most successful pull requests usually look a like this:

  * Fill in the required template
  * Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible.
  * Unit tests, while optional are awesome, thank you!
  * New code is commented with documentation from which [the reference documentation](https://our.umbraco.org/documentation/Reference/) is generated

Again, these are guidelines, not strict requirements. 

## Making changes after the PR was opened

If you make the corrections we ask for in the same branch and push them to your fork again, the pull request automatically updates with the additional commit(s) so we can review it again. If all is well, we'll merge the code and your commits are forever part of Umbraco!

## Reviews

You're an awesome person and sent us your first contribution in the form of a pull request, congratulations! Now what?  It's now time to relax for a bit and wait for our response. 

The [pull request team](#the-pr-team) can now start reviewing your proposed changes and give you feedback on them. If it's not perfect, we'll either fix up what we need or we can request you to make some additional changes.

We have [a process in place which you can read all about](REVIEW_PROCESS.md). The very abbreviated version is:

- Your PR will get a reply within 48 hours
- An in-depth reply will be added within at most 2 weeks
- The PR will be either merged or rejected within at most 4 weeks
- Sometimes it is difficult to meet these timelines and we'll talk to you# Review process



In order to set some expectations, here's what happens next.

### Review process

You will get an initial reply within 48 hours (workdays) to acknowledge that we’ve seen your PR and we’ll pick it up as soon as we can.

You will get feedback within at most 14 days after opening the PR. You’ll most likely get feedback sooner though. Then there are a few possible outcomes:

- Your proposed change is awesome! We merge it in and it will be included in the next minor release of Umbraco
- If the change is a high priority bug fix, we will cherry-pick it into the next patch release as well so that we can release it as soon as possible
- Your proposed change is awesome but needs a bit more work, we’ll give you feedback on the changes we’d like to see
- Your proposed change is awesome but.. not something we’re looking to include at this point. We’ll close your PR and the related issue (we’ll be nice about it!)

### Are you still available?

We understand you have other things to do and can't just drop everything to help us out.   
So if we’re asking for your help to improve the PR we’ll wait for two weeks to give you a fair chance to make changes. We’ll ask for an update if we don’t hear back from you after that time.  

If we don’t hear back from you for 4 weeks, we’ll close the PR so that it doesn’t just hang around forever. You’re very welcome to re-open it once you have some more time to spend on it.  

There will be times that we really like your proposed changes and we’ll finish the final improvements we’d like to see ourselves. You still get the credits and your commits will live on in the git repository.

## The PR team

The pull request team consists of a member of Umbraco HQ, [Sebastiaan](https://github.com/nul800sebastiaan), who gets assistance from the following community members

- [Anders Bjerner](https://github.com/abjerner)
- [Dave Woestenborghs](https://github.com/dawoe)
- [Emma Burstow](https://github.com/emmaburstow)
- [Kyle Weems](https://github.com/cssquirrel)
- [Poornima Nayar](https://github.com/poornimanayar)

These wonderful volunteers will provide you with a first reply to your PR, review and test out your changes and might ask more questions. After that they'll let Umbraco HQ know if everything seems okay. 

## Questions?

You can get in touch with [the PR team](#the-pr-team) in multiple ways, we love open conversations and we are a friendly bunch. No question you have is stupid. Any questions you have usually helps out multiple people with the same question. Ask away:

- If there's an existing issue on the issue tracker then that's a good place to leave questions and discuss how to start or move forward
- Unsure where to start? Did something not work as expected? Try leaving a note in the ["Contributing to Umbraco"](https://our.umbraco.org/forum/contributing-to-umbraco-cms/) forum, the team monitors that one closely
- We're also [active in the Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)
