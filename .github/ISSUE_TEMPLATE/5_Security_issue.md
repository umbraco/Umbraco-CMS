A note on "Self XSS"
--------------------

Umbraco is a CMS, that allows users to edit content on a website. As such,
all _authenticated users_ can:

 - Edit content, and (depending on the field types) insert HTML and CSS in that
   content, with a variety of allowed attributes.
 - Depending on the user level: Edit template files, and insert C#, HTML, CSS and
   javascript in so on.
 - Upload files to the site, which will become publicly available.

We see these functionalities as _features_, and not as security issues. Please
report the mentioned items only if they can be performed by non-authorized
users, or other exploitable vulnerabilities.

Thanks!
