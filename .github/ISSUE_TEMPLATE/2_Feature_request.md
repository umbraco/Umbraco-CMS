If you want to discuss the feature you're imagining, please make sure to keep
those discussions on the forum at https://our.umbraco.com/ (choose the

How can you help?
-------------------------------

<!--
The resources (read: available time and effort) of Umbraco's core team are
limited.

If we can not work on your suggestion, please don't take it personally. Most
likely, it's either:

 - We think your idea is valid, but we can't find the time to work on it.
 - Your idea might be better suited as a package, if it's not suitable for
   the majority of users.
