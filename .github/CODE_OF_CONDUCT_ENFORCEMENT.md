# Umbraco Code of Conduct Enforcement guidelines - Consequence Ladder  

These are the steps followed by the [Umbraco Code of Conduct Team](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS/blob/v8/contrib/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when we respond to an issue or incident brought to our attention by a community member.  

This is an appendix to the Code of Conduct and is updated and maintained by the Code of Conduct Team.  

To make sure that all reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, as highlighted in the Umbraco Code of Conduct, we are following [Mozillaâ€™s Consequence Ladder approach](https://github.com/mozilla/inclusion/blob/master/code-of-conduct-enforcement/consequence-ladder.md).  

This approach helps the Team enforce the Code of Conduct in a structured manner and can be used as a way of communicating escalation. Each time the Team takes an action (warning, ban) the individual is made aware of future consequences. The Team can either follow the order of the levels in the ladder or decide to jump levels. When needed, the team can go directly to a permanent ban.  

**Level 0: No Action**  
Recommendations do not indicate a violation of the Code of Conduct.  

**Level 1: Simple Warning Issued**  
A private, written warning from the Code of Conduct Team, with clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior.  

**Level 2: Warning**  
A private, written warning from the Code of Conduct Team, with clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior. Additionally:  

* Communication of next-level consequences if behaviors are repeated (according to this ladder).  

**Level 3: Warning + Mandatory Cooling Off Period (Access Retained)**  
A private warning from the Code of Conduct Team, with clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior. Additionally:  

* Request to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms (public forums, Our, commenting on issues).  
  * This includes avoiding any interactions in any Umbraco channels, spaces/offices, as well as external channels like social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn). For example, 'following/liking/retweeting' would be considered a violation of these terms, and consequence would escalate according to this ladder.  
* Require they do not interact with others in the report, or those who they suspect are involved in the report.  
* Suggestions for 'out of office' type of message on platforms, to reduce curiosity, or suspicion among those not involved.  

**Level 4: Temporary Ban (Access Revoked)**  
Private communication of ban from the Code of Conduct Team, with clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior. Additionally:  

* 3-6 months imposed break.  
* All accounts deactivated, or blocked during this time (Our, HQ Slack if applicable).  
* Require to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms (public forums, Our, commenting on issues).  
  * This includes avoiding any interactions in any Umbraco channels, spaces/offices, as well as external channels like social media (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn). For example, 'following/liking/retweeting' would be considered a violation of these terms, and consequence would escalate according to this ladder.  
* All community leadership roles (e.g. Community Teams, Meetup/festival organizer, Commit right on Github..) suspended. (onboarding/reapplication required outside of this process)  
* No attendance at Umbraco events during the ban period.  
* Not allowed to enter Umbraco HQ offices during the ban period.  
* Permission to use the MVP title, if applicable, is revoked during this ban period.  
* The community leaders running events and other initiatives are informed of the ban.  

**Level 5: Permanent Ban**  
Private communication of ban from the Code of Conduct Team, with clarity of violation, consequences of continued behavior. Additionally:  

* All accounts deactivated permanently.  
* No attendance at Umbraco events going forward.  
* Not allowed to enter Umbraco HQ offices permanently.  
* All community leadership roles (e.g. Community Teams, Meetup/festival organizer, Commit right on Github..) permanently suspended.  
* Permission to use the MVP title, if applicable, revoked.  
* The community leaders running events and other initiatives are informed of the ban.
