# Quick Start

The short version goes like this:

  * **Fork** - create a fork of [`Umbraco-CMS` on GitHub](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS)

  * **Clone** - when GitHub has created your fork, you can clone it in your favorite Git tool

  * **Build** - build your fork of Umbraco locally as described in [building Umbraco from source code](6_CONTRIBUTION.md#building-umbraco-from-source-code)
  * **Change** - make your changes, experiment, have fun, explore and learn, and don't be afraid. We welcome all contributions and will [happily give feedback](5_GUIDELINES.md#questions)
  * **Commit** - done? Yay! 🎉 It is recommended to create a new branch now and name it after the issue you're fixing, we usually follow the format: `temp-U4-12345`. This means it's a temporary branch for the particular issue you're working on, in this case `U4-12345`
  * **Push** - great, now you can push the changes up to your fork on GitHub
  * **Create pull request** - exciting! You're ready to show us your changes (or not quite ready, you just need some feedback to progress). GitHub has picked up on the new branch you've pushed and will offer to create a Pull Request. Click that green button and away you go.
