## Getting Started

[Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/cloud) is the easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet, with full support for all your custom .NET code and integrations. You're up and running in less than a minute, and your life will be made easier with automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. We offer a free 14-day trial, no credit card needed.

If you want to DIY, then you can [download Umbraco]((https://our.umbraco.com/download)) either as a ZIP file or via NuGet. It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud, but you'll need to find a place to host it yourself, and handling deployments and upgrades will be all up to you.

## Documentation

The documentation for Umbraco CMS can be found [on Our Umbraco](https://docs.umbraco.com/). The source for the Umbraco docs is [open source as well](https://github.com/umbraco/UmbracoDocs) and we're happy to look at your documentation contributions.
