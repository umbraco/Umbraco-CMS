## Umbraco - The Friendly CMS

For the first time on the Microsoft platform, there is a free user and developer friendly CMS that makes it quick and easy to create websites - or a breeze to build complex web applications. Umbraco has award-winning integration capabilities and supports ASP.NET MVC or Web Forms, including User and Custom Controls, out of the box.

Umbraco is not only loved by developers, but is a content editors dream. Enjoy intuitive editing tools, media management, responsive views and approval workflows to send your content live.

Used by more than 443,000 active websites including Carlsberg, Segway, Amazon and Heinz and **The Official ASP.NET and IIS.NET website from Microsoft** ([https://asp.net](https://asp.net) / [https://iis.net](https://iis.net)), you can be sure that the technology is proven, stable and scales. Backed by the team at Umbraco HQ, and supported by a dedicated community of over 220,000 craftspeople globally, you can trust that Umbraco is a safe choice and is here to stay.

## Why Open Source?
As an Open Source platform, Umbraco is more than just a CMS. We are transparent with our roadmap for future versions, our incremental sprint planning notes are publicly accessible and community contributions and packages are available for all to use.

## Trying out Umbraco CMS

[Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/cloud) is the easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet with full support for all your custom .NET code and intergrations. You're up and running in less than a minute and your life will be made easier with automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. We offer a free 14 day trial, no credit card needed.

If you want to DIY you can [download Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/download) either as a ZIP file or via NuGet. It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud, but you'll need to find a place to host yourself and handling deployments and upgrades is all down to you.

## Community

Our friendly community is available 24/7 at the community hub we call ["Our Umbraco"](https://our.umbraco.com). Our Umbraco feature forums for questions and answers, documentation, downloadable plugins for Umbraco and a rich collection of community resources.
