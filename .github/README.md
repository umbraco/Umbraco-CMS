_Ready to try out Version 8? [See the quick start guide](V8_GETTING_STARTED.md)._

When is Umbraco 8 coming?
=========================
When it's ready. We're done with the major parts of the architecture work and are focusing on three separate tracks to prepare Umbraco 8 for release:
1) Editor Track (_currently in progress_). Without editors, there's no market for Umbraco. So we want to make sure that Umbraco 8 is full of love for editors.
2) Partner Track. Without anyone implementing Umbraco, there's nothing for editors to update. So we want to make sure that Umbraco 8 is a joy to implement
3) Contributor Track. Without our fabulous ecosystem of both individual Umbracians and 3rd party ISVs, Umbraco wouldn't be as rich a platform as it is today. We want to make sure that it's easy, straight forward and as backwards-compatible as possible to create packages for Umbraco

Once a track is done, we start releasing previews where we ask people to test the features we believe are ready. While the testing is going on and we gather feedback, we move on to the next track. This doesn't mean that there hasn't already been work done in the area, but that a track focuses on finalizing, polishing and preparing the features for release.

## Umbraco - The Friendly CMS

For the first time on the Microsoft platform, there is a free user- and developer-friendly CMS that makes it quick and easy to create websites - and a breeze to build complex web applications. Umbraco has award-winning integration capabilities and supports ASP.NET MVC or Web Forms, including User and Custom Controls, right out of the box.

Umbraco is not only loved by developers, but is a content editor's dream. Enjoy intuitive editing tools, media management, responsive views, and approval workflows to send your content live.

Used by more than 443,000 active websites including Carlsberg, Segway, Amazon and Heinz and **The Official ASP.NET and IIS.NET website from Microsoft** ([https://asp.net](https://asp.net) / [https://iis.net](https://iis.net)), you can be sure that the technology is proven, stable and scalable. Backed by the team at Umbraco HQ, and supported by a dedicated community of over 220,000 craftspeople globally, you can trust that Umbraco is a safe choice and is here to stay.

## Why Open Source?
As an Open Source platform, Umbraco is more than just a CMS. We are transparent with our roadmap for future versions, our incremental sprint planning notes are publicly accessible, and community contributions and packages are available for all to use.

## Trying out Umbraco CMS

[Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/cloud) is the easiest and fastest way to use Umbraco yet, with full support for all your custom .NET code and integrations. You're up and running in less than a minute, and your life will be made easier with automated upgrades and a built-in deployment engine. We offer a free 14-day trial, no credit card needed.

If you want to DIY, you can [download Umbraco](https://our.umbraco.com/download) either as a ZIP file or via NuGet. It's the same version of Umbraco CMS that powers Umbraco Cloud, but you'll need to find a place to host it yourself, and handling deployments and upgrades will be all up to you.

## Community

Our friendly community is available 24/7 at the community hub we call ["Our Umbraco"](https://our.umbraco.com). Our Umbraco features forums for questions and answers, documentation, downloadable plugins for Umbraco, and a rich collection of community resources.
