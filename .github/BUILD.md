# Umbraco CMS Build

## Are you sure?

In order to use Umbraco as a CMS and build your website with it, you should not build it yourself. If you're reading this then you're trying to contribute to Umbraco or you're debugging a complex issue.

- Are you about to create a pull request for Umbraco?
- Are you trying to get to the bottom of a problem in your existing Umbraco installation?

If the answer is yes, please read on. Otherwise, make sure to head on over [to the download page](https://our.umbraco.com/download) and start using Umbraco CMS as intended.

## Building from source

Did you read ["Are you sure"](#are-you-sure)?

### Quick!

To build Umbraco, fire up PowerShell and move to Umbraco's repository root (the directory that contains `src`, `build`, `LICENSE.md`...). There, trigger the build with the following command:

    build/build.ps1
    
If you only see a build.bat-file, you're probably on the wrong branch. If you switch to the correct branch (dev-v8) the file will appear and you can build it.

You might run into [Powershell quirks](#powershell-quirks).

### Build Infrastructure

The Umbraco Build infrastructure relies on a PowerShell object. The object can be retrieved with:

    $ubuild = build/build.ps1 -get

The object exposes various properties and methods that can be used to fine-grain build Umbraco. Some, but not all, of them are detailed below.
    
#### Properties

The object exposes the following properties:

* `SolutionRoot`: the absolute path to the solution root
* `VisualStudio`: a Visual Studio object (see below)
* `NuGet`: the absolute path to the NuGet executable
* `Zip`: the absolute path to the 7Zip executable
* `VsWhere`: the absolute path to the VsWhere executable
* `NodePath`: the absolute path to the Node install
* `NpmPath`: the absolute path to the Npm install

The Visual Studio object is `null` when Visual Studio has not been detected (eg on VSTS). When not null, the object exposes the following properties:

* `Path`: Visual Studio installation path (eg some place under `Program Files`)
* `Major`: Visual Studio major version (eg `15` for VS 2017)
* `Minor`: Visual Studio minor version
* `MsBuild`: the absolute path to the MsBuild executable

#### GetUmbracoVersion

Gets an object representing the current Umbraco version. Example:

    $v = $ubuild.GetUmbracoVersion()
    Write-Host $v.Semver

The object exposes the following properties:

* `Semver`: the semver object representing the version
* `Release`: the main part of the version (eg `7.6.33`)
* `Comment`: the pre release part of the version (eg `alpha02`)
* `Build`: the build number part of the version (eg `1234`)

#### SetUmbracoVersion

Modifies Umbraco files with the new version.

>This entirely replaces the legacy `UmbracoVersion.txt` file. Do *not* edit version infos in files.

The version must be a valid semver version. It can include a *pre release* part (eg `alpha02`) and/or a *build number* (eg `1234`). Examples:

    $ubuild.SetUmbracoVersion("7.6.33")
    $ubuild.SetUmbracoVersion("7.6.33-alpha.2")
    $ubuild.SetUmbracoVersion("7.6.33+1234")
    $ubuild.SetUmbracoVersion("7.6.33-beta.5+5678")

#### Build

Builds Umbraco. Temporary files are generated in `build.tmp` while the actual artifacts (zip files, NuGet packages...) are produced in `build.out`. Example:

    $ubuild.Build()

Some log files, such as MsBuild logs, are produced in `build.tmp` too. The `build` directory should remain clean during a build.

**Note: web.config**

Building Umbraco requires a clean `web.config` file in the `Umbraco.Web.UI` project. If a `web.config` file already exists, the `pre-build` task (see below) will save it as `web.config.temp-build` and replace it with a clean copy of `web.Template.config`. The original file is replaced once it is safe to do so, by the `pre-packages` task.

#### Build-UmbracoDocs

Builds umbraco documentation. Temporary files are generated in `build.tmp` while the actual artifacts (docs...) are produced in `build.out`. Example:

    Build-UmbracoDocs

Some log files, such as MsBuild logs, are produced in `build.tmp` too. The `build` directory should remain clean during a build.

#### Verify-NuGet

Verifies that projects all require the same version of their dependencies, and that NuSpec files require versions that are consistent with projects. Example:

    Verify-NuGet

### Cleaning up

Once the solution has been used to run a site, one may want to "reset" the solution in order to run a fresh new site again.

At the very minimum, you want

    git clean -Xdf src/Umbraco.Web.UI/App_Data
    rm src/Umbraco.Web.UI/web.config

Then, a simple 'Rebuild All' in Visual Studio will recreate a fresh `web.config` but should be quite fast (since it does not really need to rebuild anything).

The `clean` Git command force (`-f`) removes (`-X`, note the capital X) all files and directories (`-d`) that are ignored by Git.

This will leave media files and views around, but in most cases, it will be enough.

To perform a more complete clear, you will want to also delete the content of the media, views, scripts... directories.

The following command will force remove all untracked files and directories, whether they are ignored by Git or not. Combined with `git reset` it can recreate a pristine working directory. 

    git clean -xdf .

## Azure DevOps

Umbraco uses Azure DevOps for continuous integration, nightly builds and release builds. The Umbraco CMS project on DevOps [is available for anonymous users](https://umbraco.visualstudio.com/Umbraco%20Cms).

DevOps uses the `Build-Umbraco` command several times, each time passing a different *target* parameter. The supported targets are:

* `pre-build`: prepares the build
* `compile-belle`: compiles Belle
* `compile-umbraco`: compiles Umbraco
* `pre-tests`: prepares the tests
* `compile-tests`: compiles the tests
* `pre-packages`: prepares the packages
* `pkg-zip`: creates the zip files
* `pre-nuget`: prepares NuGet packages
* `pkg-nuget`: creates NuGet packages

All these targets are executed when `Build-Umbraco` is invoked without a parameter (or with the `all` parameter). On VSTS, compilations (of Umbraco and tests) are performed by dedicated DevOps tasks. Similarly, creating the NuGet packages is also performed by dedicated DevOps tasks.

Finally, the produced artifacts are published in two containers that can be downloaded from DevOps: `zips` contains the zip files while `nuget` contains the NuGet packages.

>During a DevOps build, some environment `UMBRACO_*` variables are exported by the `pre-build` target and can be reused in other targets *and* in DevOps tasks. The `UMBRACO_TMP` environment variable is used in `Umbraco.Tests` to disable some tests that have issues with DevOps at the moment.

## Quirks

### PowerShell Quirks

There is a good chance that running `build.ps1` ends up in error, with messages such as

>The file ...\build.ps1 is not digitally signed. You cannot run this script on the current system. For more information about running scripts and setting execution policy, see about_Execution_Policies.

PowerShell has *Execution Policies* that may prevent the script from running. You can check the current policies with:

    PS> Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
    
            Scope ExecutionPolicy
            ----- ---------------
    MachinePolicy       Undefined
       UserPolicy       Undefined
          Process       Undefined
      CurrentUser       Undefined
     LocalMachine    RemoteSigned

Policies can be `Restricted`, `AllSigned`, `RemoteSigned`, `Unrestricted` and `Bypass`. Scopes can be `MachinePolicy`, `UserPolicy`, `Process`, `CurrentUser`, `LocalMachine`. You need the current policy to be `RemoteSigned`&mdash;as long as it is `Undefined`, the script cannot run. You can change the current user policy with:

    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

Alternatively, you can do it at machine level, from within an elevated PowerShell session:

    PS> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

And *then* the script should run. It *might* however still complain about executing scripts, with messages such as:

>Security warning - Run only scripts that you trust. While scripts from the internet can be useful, this script can potentially harm your computer. If you trust this script, use the Unblock-File cmdlet to allow the script to run without this warning message. Do you want to run ...\build.ps1?
[D] Do not run  [R] Run once  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "D"):

This is usually caused by the scripts being *blocked*. And that usually happens when the source code has been downloaded as a Zip file. When Windows downloads Zip files, they are marked as *blocked* (technically, they have a Zone.Identifier alternate data stream, with a value of "3" to indicate that they were downloaded from the Internet). And when such a Zip file is un-zipped, each and every single file is also marked as blocked.

The best solution is to unblock the Zip file before un-zipping: right-click the files, open *Properties*, and there should be a *Unblock* checkbox at the bottom of the dialog. If, however, the Zip file has already been un-zipped, it is possible to recursively unblock all files from PowerShell with:

    PS> Get-ChildItem -Recurse *.* | Unblock-File

### Git Quirks

Git might have issues dealing with long file paths during build. You may want/need to enable `core.longpaths` support (see [this page](https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/wiki/Git-cannot-create-a-file-or-directory-with-a-long-path) for details).
