*** IMPORTANT NOTICE FOR UPGRADES FROM VERSIONS BELOW 7.7.0 ***

Be sure to read the version specific upgrade information before proceeding:
https://our.umbraco.com/documentation/Getting-Started/Setup/Upgrading/version-specific#version-7-7-0

Depending on the version you are upgrading from, you may need to make some changes to your web.config
and you will need to be aware of the breaking changes listed there to see if these affect your installation.


Don't forget to build!

We've done our best to transform your configuration files but in case something is not quite right: remember we
backed up your files in App_Data\NuGetBackup so you can find the original files before they were transformed.

We've overwritten all the files in the Umbraco and Umbraco_Client folder, these have been backed up in 
App_Data\NuGetBackup. We didn't overwrite the UI.xml file nor did we remove any files or folders that you or 
a package might have added. Only the existing files were overwritten. If you customized anything then make 
sure to do a compare and merge with the NuGetBackup folder.

This NuGet package includes build targets that extend the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by 
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.
The following items will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file 
system: umbraco, umbraco_client, config\splashes and global.asax.
