Don't forget to build!

We've done our best to transform your configuration files but in case something is not quite right: we recommmend you look in source control for the previous version so you can find the original files before they were transformed.

This NuGet package includes build targets that extend the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.

The following items will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file
system: umbraco, config\splashes and global.asax.

Please read the release notes on our.umbraco.com:
