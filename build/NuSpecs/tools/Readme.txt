A note about running Umbraco from Visual Studio.

When upgrading your website using nuget a backup of config files and web.config will be created. Only the web.config will
be overwritten by default to ensure that it has the necessary settings from the current release. This means that you'll 
have to merge the files if you made any changes to the previous config files.
The config files found in the config folder will usually not be changed for patch releases, so they can usually be skipped,
but the web.config will have to have its previous "umbracoConfigurationStatus"-appsetting and "umbracoDbDSN" connection string
copied over (as a minimum).

This nuget package includes build targets that extends the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by 
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.
These folders will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file system:
umbraco and umbraco_client.
