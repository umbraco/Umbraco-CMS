Don't forget to build!


When upgrading your website using NuGet you should answer "No" to the questions to overwrite the Web.config
file (and config files in the config folder).

This NuGet package includes build targets that extend the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.
The following items will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file
system: umbraco, config\splashes and global.asax.

Please read the release notes on our.umbraco.com:
