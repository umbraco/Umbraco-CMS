A note about running Umbraco from Visual Studio.

When upgrading your website using NuGet you should answer "No" to the questions to overwrite the Web.config 
file (and config files in the config folder). 
We will overwrite Web.config anyway but we keep a backup in the App_Data\NuGetBackup folder. There you'll 
find a folder with the current date and time in which the backup has been placed. Make sure to merge the 
new file with the old backup files before you proceed.
The web.config will be overwritten by default to ensure that it has the necessary settings from the current release. 

We've also overwritten all the files in the Umbraco and Umbraco_Client folder, these have also been backed up in 
App_Data\NuGetBackup. We didn't overwrite the UI.xml file nor did we remove any files or folders that you or a package
might have added. Only the existing files were overwritten. If you customized anything then make sure to do a compare 
and merge with the NuGetBackup folder.

The config files found in the config folder will usually not be changed for patch releases, so they can usually be skipped,
but the web.config will have to have its previous "umbracoConfigurationStatus"-appsetting and "umbracoDbDSN" connection string
copied over (as a minimum).

This nuget package includes build targets that extends the creation of a deploy package, which is generated by 
Publishing from Visual Studio. The targets will only work once Publishing is configured, so if you don't use
Publish this won't affect you.
These things will now be automatically included when creating a deploy package or publishing to the file system:
umbraco, umbraco_client, config\splashes and global.asax.
